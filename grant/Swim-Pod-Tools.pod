=head2 Synopsis

Provide Swim tools that allow Perl programmers to produce elaborate Pod
documention, painlessly.

Provide all the functionality of Pod in a syntax better than Markdown.

Provide 5 plugins for extending Swim in ways useful to Perl people.

=head2 Benefits to the Perl Community

Pod excels in providing a great B<model> for documentation. That means it
supports all (most of) the semantic concepts needed to write great docs. Where
Pod falls down is on syntax. The syntax is so verbose that common idioms (like
creating lists of lists) are often avoided because they are to hard to write.

Many Perl people use Markdown which offers simpler syntax, but lacks many of
the common semantic idioms in Pod. For instance, Markdown has no ability to do
'Data Definition' lists that are so common in CPAN docs (C<dl/dt/dd> HTML
tags). Markdown is also weak in nesting semantic blocks.

This summer Ingy created Swim, after thinking about it and discussing it for 8
years. He has converted all the documentation in over 80 of his CPAN (and
other language) distributions. The result is incredibly easy to write and
maintain doc, all published to Pod for CPAN and GitHub rendering.

=head2 Bio

Ingy döt Net has created markup languages in the past including the Kwiki wiki
markup and the Socialtext wiki markup. He is extremely familiar with parsing,
syntax and semantics issues in this space.

David Oswald has been a Perl user for over a decade, is an author of several
CPAN modules, and maintainer of more. David also runs Salt Lake Perl Mongers.

Ingy and David work well together and have decided to collaborate on a number
of projects that will benefit Perl and Software Development.
