=head1 Pegex Grammar for YAML

=head2 Synopsis

Make YAML.pm and YAML::Tiny driven by a common formal grammar.

=head2 Benefits to the Perl Community

Perl has four major YAML implementations:

=over

=item * L<YAML>

=item * L<YAML::Tiny>

=item * L<YAML::XS>

=item * L<YAML::Syck>

=back

They all have major incompatabilities. In the past year the #yaml channel on
irc.perl.org has gotten all the right people together to resolve this. A great
next step would be to make the two pure Perl implementations L<YAML> and
L<YAML::Tiny> be grammar driven.

L<Pegex> is a Perl 6 Rules inspired framework that greatly lowers the barriers
to writing parsers. The main goal of Pegex is to make grammars for parsing a
language or syntax be as human friendly as possible. Pegex is also extremely
fast for pure Perl code.

By having the Load functions for L<YAML> and L<YAML::Tiny> be grammar driven,
the following benefits would occur:

=over

=item 1.

Both modules would parse the same YAML exactly the same

=item 2.

Bugs could easily be fixed for both modules in the same grammar

=item 3.

YAML::Tiny would be tinyer

=item 4.

YAML.pm would become faster

=back

=head2 Deliverables

This project will provide:

=over

=item * Pegex grammar for YAML

=item * L<YAML> and L<YAML::Tiny> parser/loaders based on the grammar

=item * Common test suite proving compatability

=back

=head2 Project Details

Pegex is four years old, and has several CPAN modules based on it. It makes
language defining grammars appear crystal clear. It has undergone an
optimization development phase that makes it very fast.

Recent work was done to get YAML indentation working in Pegex. This was a
major hurdle. This is now a good time to make a complete YAML grammar. Since
Pegex works in many languages, eventually there will be exactly compatible
YAML parsers in Perl, Python, RUby, JS, etc.

=head2 Inch-stones

=over

=item * Write a grammar for YAML in Pegex

=over

=item * Grammar will be well documented

=item * Each grammar rule will be tested

=back

=item * Convert L<YAML> to use the grammar for its loader

=item * Convert L<YAML::Tiny> to use (a subset of) the grammar for its loader

=item * Both modules pass a common test suite

=back

=head2 Project Schedule

This project will take 2-3 months and can be started immediately upon
acceptance.

=head2 Completeness Criteria

Both modules released to CPAN, using the new Pegex grammar and passing the
same tests. Pegex/YAML grammar published in its own GitHub repo.

=head2 Bio

Ingy döt Net invented the YAML language, is the author and maintainer of
L<YAML> and L<YAML::XS> and is one of he people currently actively maintaining
L<YAML::Tiny>. He also is the creator of the Pegex parsing framework.

David Oswald has been a Perl user for over a decade, is an author of several
CPAN modules, and maintainer of more. David also runs Salt Lake Perl Mongers.

Ingy and David work well together and have decided to collaborate on a number
of projects that will benefit Perl and Software Development.
