=head2 Synopsis

Rewrite IO::All to match the needs of 10 years experience.

=head2 Benefits to the Perl Community

IO::All is a Perl module that attempts to make all Input/Output operations in
Perl, as simple, normal, and uniform as possible. IO::All has been in
existence since 2004. It is useful and somewhat extensible, but has a number
of inconsistencies, flaws and misgivings.

The proposal is the refactor and/or rewrite the IO::All code to become the
perfect way to encode almost all of Perl IO needs. In other words:

=over

=item * All things are done safely

=item * Unicode issues are all handled correctly

=item * Options have the proper scope (lexicalI<package>object)

=item * Can be used safely in production

=item * Stays simple for 1-liners (small needs)

=item * Internals are all plugin based rather than semi-hardcoded

=item * Defaults are sane

=item * Mo(o(se)) compatible OO

=item * Weirder stuff like operator overloads need not be turned on explicitly

=back

=head2 Deliverables

Using the L<Alt> module strategy, we deliver an L<Alt-IO-All-Redux> dist that
installs a new IO::All. This is tested in beta until deemed safe to release
properly as the new IO-All dist.

Current IO::All plugins are revised to the new strategy.

=over

=item * Create Alt-IO-All-Redux dist so that new code can be used and tested by the community immediately.

=item * Write tests for new behaviors.

=item * Refactor the code to match the new design.

=item * Port current IO::All extension modules to new design

=item * Get people on #io-all IRC channel and beyond to test the rewrite

=item * Release as IO-All when deemed ready

=head2 Project Schedule

This project will take 2 months and can be started immediately upon
acceptance.

=head2 Completeness Criteria

Alt-IO-All-Redux passes all tests, is vetted by the community and is released
to CPAN as the new IO-All dist.

=head2 Bio

Ingy döt Net wrote IO::All in 2004. Of his many CPAN modules, it is probably
one of the 3 most popular.

David Oswald has been a Perl user for over a decade, is an author of several
CPAN modules, and maintainer of more. David also runs Salt Lake Perl Mongers.

Ingy and David work well together and have decided to collaborate on a number
of big projects that benefit Perl and Software Development.
